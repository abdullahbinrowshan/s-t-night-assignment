# Creating the QuizzyBee Website
I was assigned to create the QuizzyBee website for my Programming Hero web course. I used Vite React, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, AI-generated logos, Toastify, and Recharts to create the website. 

## Quiz Topics
The website offers quizzes on several topics, including ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS, and GIT.

## Using React Router Loader and useLoadedData Hook
The website makes use of React Router Loader and the useLoadedData Hook to efficiently load and display the different quiz topics and questions.

## Build Folder Issue
I encountered an issue with the build folder not being created when I run the `npm run build` command. After some research, I found a solution on Stack Overflow by adding code to the `vite.config.js` file.

## Flowbite Navbar Toggle Issue
While using Flowbite, I had some trouble with the navbar toggle not working correctly. I debugged the hidden class and used the useState hook to toggle the class on the navbar for mobile devices.

## Toastify Notifications
I used Toastify notifications to display pop-up messages for the user, such as success messages, warnings, and errors.

## Recharts Library
For the charts on the website, I used the Recharts library. While the library made it easy to integrate charts into my React application, I did encounter some issues with responsiveness on mobile devices.

## AI-Generated Logo
I used a Dall-e 2 generated logo for the QuizzyBee website, which featured a bee as the main character.

## ChatGPT Prompt
To write the prompt and blog components for the QuizzyBee website, I used ChatGPT.

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning React JS. It was a completely different approach than what I had previously learned with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, once I got the hang of it, everything was in one place, making it easy to work with.

Overall, I found creating the QuizzyBee website to be a fun and engaging project.
